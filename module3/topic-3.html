		<h1>How It Has Evolved</h1>
		<p>
		Even though the Americano is a fairly simple drink, espresso with some hot water added in, there have been variations created throughout the years. Some of these variations include:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Iced Americano</strong>: made when you combine the espresso with cold water instead of hot water. Pretty simple right?!</li>
		<li><strong>Lungo</strong>: made by extracting the espresso for longer and with more water. It gives the lungo more volume but also some bitter notes.</li> 
		<li><strong>Caff√® crema</strong>: made by extracting an espresso shot significantly longer than a lungo.</li>
		<br/>
        <h2>What is the difference between an americano and a regular drip coffee?</h2>
		The espresso shot is far more concentrated when compared to its traditional drip coffee. Even though espresso has a shorter extraction time than drip coffee, it extracts more flavor in less time, yielding a sweeter and less bitter cup.
		Your standard drip coffee is brewed by letting hot water drip through the ground.
		An Americano is made by adding hot water to espresso until it's roughly the same strength as regular coffee.
