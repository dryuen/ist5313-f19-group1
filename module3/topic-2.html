		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>
		The term "Americano" means "American", and derives from American Spanish, dating to the 1970s, or from Italy. The term "caff√® Americano" specifically is Italian for "American coffee". There is a popular, but unconfirmed, belief that the name has its origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy would dilute espresso with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed.
		<br/><br/>In a New York Times blog on the subject of Marines and coffee, they state that by the time WWII came around the US servicemen were drinking so much coffee that the Army Quartermaster Corps would go so far as to grind, package and ship coffee overseas just so the military would have enough to go around. 
Soldiers were used to the drip coffee they would drink at home, so when they encountered coffee made in a different way, it was sometimes unenjoyable and too bitter for them. This is where the Americano was born. Adding water to the espresso the soldiers came across in Italy was the easiest way they found to make the coffee feel more like home. The Americano soon became an increasingly popular drink both across Europe and in the United States.
