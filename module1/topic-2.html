		<h1>History and Origin</h1>
		<p>
		Mixing coffee and milk has been extremely popular all over Europe since the 17th century. But where does the name come from? The word <q>latte</q> in Italian literally means <q>milk</q>. When speaking about the coffee drink, <q>latte</q> is short for <q>caffe latte</q> which literally means <q>coffee and milk</q>. Many different countries also have their own term for this type of drink. In Spain people drink <q>cafe con leche</q>, in Germany they call it <q>Milchkaffee</q>, in France you can order <q>cafe au lait</q>. However, the commercial version of this particular coffee drink comes from the United States. Even though lattes have been part of the typical breakfast in the home for generations, public cafe in Europe and the United States seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century. 

		<br/><br/>The Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, <q>invented</q> and <q>made the latte a standard drink</q> in the 1950s. The latte was popularized in Seattle, Washington in the early 1980s and spread more widely in the early 1990s.
