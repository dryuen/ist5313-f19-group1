		<h1>History and Origin</h1>
		<p>
		Mixing coffee and milk has been extremely popular all over Europe since the 17th century. But where does the name come from? The word â€œlatteâ€� in Italian literally means â€œmilk.â€� When speaking about the coffee drink, â€œlatteâ€� is short for â€œcaffÃ¨ latteâ€� which literally means â€œcoffee and milk.â€� Many different countries also have their own term for this type of drink. In Spain people drink â€œcafÃ© con lecheâ€�, in Germany they call it â€œMilchkaffee,â€� in France you can order â€œcafÃ© au lait.â€� However, the commercial version of this particular coffee drink comes from the United States. Even though lattes have been part of the typical breakfast in the home for generations, public cafÃ©s in Europe and the United States seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century. 

		<br/><br/>The Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, "invented" and "made the latte a standard drink" in the 1950s. The latte was popularized in Seattle, Washington in the early 1980s and spread more widely in the early 1990s.
