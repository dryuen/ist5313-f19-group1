		<h1>How It Has Evolved</h1>
		<p>
		As with many of our favorite foods and beverages, the origins of the latte are a bit unclear. As mentioned before, Europeans have been mixing coffee and milk for centuries, particularly in places like Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and Austria. However the modern latte—which is made with a shot or more of espresso—is widely considered an American invention. It claims to attain its popularity in Seattle in the 1980s and was a common drink throughout the U.S. by the ’90s. Today, it’s hard to imagine a time when lattes weren’t a part of our everyday lives.
		<br/><br/>As lattes became popularized, a new form of art was born. Latte art became increasingly common in coffee shops all over Europe and America. In the United States, latte art was developed in Seattle in the 1980s and 1990s, and particularly popularized by David Schomer. Nowadays, baristas add a twist to the regular latte by creating a bit of art on top of steamed milk to add aesthetic appeal. Various shapes and patterns are drawn by the way the steamed milk and foam is poured into the beverage including such designs as trees, hearts and flowers. While this can be done by hand by experienced baristas (and can be fun to try yourself at home), a much simpler solution for amateurs is to use a stencil combined with some sort of cinnamon or chocolate topping.
