		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>
		Many coffee-related terms come to us from Italian. Espresso comes from the Italian word that means "pressed-out," which explains how the coffee drink is made; macchiato is short for "caffe macchiato," which means "coffee with a spot (of milk)." Interestingly, cappuccino comes from an Italian word that refers not to coffee, but to friars.
<br/><br/>According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the Capuchin friars are members of the larger Franciscan orders of monks, and their order was founded in the 16th century in Italy. They were known for their missionary work among the poor, as well as their dedication to extreme austerity, poverty, and simplicity.
The Capuchins were also notorious for their attire, which included a simple long brown robe with a long, pointed hood that hangs down their back. The Italian word for their hood, cappuccio, gave rise to the Italian name for the order. It also gave rise to the Italian word for the famous coffee drink.
<br/><br/>Cappuccinos first popped up as the 'Kapuziner' in Viennese coffee houses in the 1700s. A description of the 'Kapuziner' from 1805 described it as "coffee with cream and sugar," and a description of the drink from 1850 adds "spices" to the recipe.
When the cappuccino drink was first introduced in Italy, it was named after the Capuchin friars because the color of the espresso mixed with frothed milk was similar to the color of the Capuchin robe. The name stuck in popular culture and it is commonly used today in most coffee shops.
