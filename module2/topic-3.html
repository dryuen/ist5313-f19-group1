		<h1>How It Has Evolved</h1>
		<p>
		After World War II, the cappuccino making went through some improvements which set the stage for cappuccino's eventual worldwide popularity. This is when the modern cappuccino was born, so to speak, as it is when all the elements we now consider to make a great cappuccino (good espresso, a balance of steamed and frothed milk, the presence of crema and a small, preheated porcelain cup) were all in play.
<br/><br/>For the most part, contemporary cappuccinos are made with espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk. However, in some parts of the world, cappuccinos are still made more like Viennese Kapuziners, complete with whipped cream and other additives.
<br/><br/>In recent years, some European cappuccino customs have changed. Most notably, in some parts of Europe people have begun to drink cappuccino throughout the entire day rather than only in the morning. Now, cappuccinos are popular at cafes in the afternoon and at restaurants after dinner.
