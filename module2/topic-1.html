		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
		Walk into any coffee shop and you can come to find people of all ages and races, sipping on a delicious milky beverage. Making its way from Europe, into Australia, to North America, then the rest of the world, the Cappuccino has become quite the beloved drink! This espresso-based coffee is full of flavor and texture and it has become quite popular over the years. Although you may have come across this coffee drink and had it yourself, you may not know where it originated from, what it consists of, and what makes it so unique. In this module we will take a look at the history of the cappucino and how it has evolved over the years. We will also look at a simple to follow cappuccino recipe and an altered recipe to meet dietary needs, this way you can master the perfect cappuccino from home and you can wave expensive coffee shops goodbye! But of course, if you&apos;d rather take the easy route and not have to make it and you&#39d rather just pick one up, then we will also provide you with where you can find it locally in San Antonio.
